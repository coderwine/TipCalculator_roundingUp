# Concept
This is meant to provide a quick tip calculator that allows for a "round-up" number to help provide whole numbers after including a tip.

Users input a check total and a desired percentage to hit. This would be considered the minimum percentage amount. 

Once the user clicks **Calculate**, it will detail what the actual amount is for those exact percent amount within the **Results** section. Following that, it will also detail how much the tip will need to be in order to round up to the nearest whole number.
